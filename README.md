# calculator
## Introduction

 - calculator performs basic arithmetic operations : + - x / 

## Self-reflection:
 -project started on 3-3-2024 and ended on 11-3-2024
 -I should learn to use "e" argument.
 -Though my original code was  working, but it became a total mess by the end and i ask chatGPT to clean the mess by removing unnecessary LOC and restructured it.

## Learning
 - justifyContent & alignitems are always relative to flex-direction: "row/col".
 - flex:1 is life saver.
