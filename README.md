# calculator
## Introduction
 - This Project is about creating a calculator with HTML,CSS,JS.
 - calculator performs basic arithmetic operations : + - x / 

## Self-reflection:
 - Since, this was the last foundation project: I decided to write allTheCode by myself ,even no hints taken from AIchatBots.
 -

## Learning
 - justifyContent & alignitems are always relative to flex-direction: "row/col".
 - flex:1 is life saver.
