# calculator
## Introduction

 - calculator performs basic arithmetic operations : + - x / 

## Self-reflection:
 - project started on 3-3-2024 and ended on 15-3-2024
 - I should learn to use "e" argument.
 - Though my original code was  working, but it became a total mess by the end and i ask chatGPT to clean the mess by removing unnecessary LOCs and restructured it.

## Learning
 - justifyContent & alignitems are always relative to flex-direction: "row/col".
 - flex:1 is life saver.
 - box-shadow
 - transition
 - linkingGoogleFonts
 - parseFloat(): function to convert stringIntoFloatingPoint else NaN.
 - audio element
